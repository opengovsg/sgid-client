# Next.js (CSR) example sgID app

This example integrates the TypeScript SDK in a Next.js project using the pages router, api routes and client-side rendering (CSR). You can copy this code to bootstrap your sgID client application, and run this app locally to understand how this SDK helps you interact with the sgID server.

## Running this example app locally

Refer to sgID's [documentation](https://docs.id.gov.sg/integrations-with-sgid/typescript-javascript/framework-guides/next.js-client-side-rendering) for a detailed guide on what this example does and how to run it locally.
